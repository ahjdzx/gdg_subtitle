00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,310
嗨  我是Dan Aminzade  是Android Wear团队的一名攻城狮
Hi, I'm Dan Aminzade, an engineer on the Android Wear team.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,570
如果你制作过安卓APP的话  你可能会困惑如何更新你的APP
If you build Android apps, you may be wondering how to update your app

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,559
使它能够更好地在可穿戴设备上工作
to work better on a wearable form factor.

4
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:11,850
在这个视频里
To give you a better idea of the changes you might want

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,350
为了让你更好地了解你可能要做出的改变  我会告诉你
to make, in this talk, I'll tell you

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,020
我们是如何更新谷歌自己的APP  使其更好的支持安卓可穿戴设备的
how we updated Google's own apps to better support Android Wear.

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,570
我将重点放在四款APP上
I'm going to focus on four apps that

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,450
来展示使用Android Wear API开发的不同点  分别是 Gmail
showcase different aspects of the Android Wear API, Gmail,

9
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,154
Hangouts  Camera和Google Maps
Hangouts, Camera and Google Maps.

10
00:00:26,154 --> 00:00:28,070
其中的每个APP展示了
Each of these apps illustrates a different set

11
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,890
Android Wear API的不同方面的特征
of features of the Android Wear API.

12
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,240
让我们从Gmail开始吧
Let's start with Gmail.

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,827
Gmail会在你的手机上产生两种类型的通知
Gmail generates two types of notifications on your phone.

14
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:36,910
一种是是像这样  当你收到一封电子邮件时
A notification like this, when you have one email.

15
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,620
另一种是像这样  当你有多封未读邮件时
And a notification like this, when you have multiple unread emails.

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,480
一封电子邮件的通知会包含这封邮件的部分片段
The notification for one email has a snippet of the email,

17
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,070
以及2个操作  归档和回复
and two actions; archive and reply.

18
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,195
不对Gmail做任何的改变
Without changing Gmail at all, the notification

19
00:00:48,195 --> 00:00:50,330
该通知会从手机推送到可穿戴设备上
would be bridged from phone to wearable,

20
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,350
并且会在屏幕上显示为一张卡片
and would show up as a card in the stream.

21
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,050
你可以在卡片上滑动来选择回复或归档
You could swipe on the card to select reply or archive.

22
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,940
问题是回复动作是否能够做的
The problem is that the reply action

23
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,320
像在手机上选择一样
would do exactly what it did when selected on the phone--

24
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,420
让你打开手机里的Gamil APP
it would open up the Gmail app on your phone,

25
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,900
然后输入回复内容
so you could type a response.

26
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,459
所以我们最先想做的
So the first thing we wanted to do

27
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:06,310
是允许人们说出快速的语音
was to allow people to speak quick voice

28
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,150
来回复他们的手表  使他们可以直接通过手腕
replies to their watch so they can answer emails directly

29
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,622
回复电子邮件
on their wrist.

30
00:01:10,622 --> 00:01:12,960
安卓的通知API现在可以
The Android notification API now lets

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,430
给通知动作
you annotate a notification action

32
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,260
添加一个远程输入  它告诉Android Wear
with a remote input, which tells Android Wear that you'd

33
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,070
在执行动作之前  你可能要通过语音收集
like to collect a bit of free form text via speech

34
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,820
一些自由形式的文本
before performing the action.

35
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,650
当我们在Gmail中创建一个通知时
When we build a notification in Gmail,

36
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,210
我们对回复动作附上一个远程输入
we attach a remote input to the reply action.

37
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,140
Android Wear捕获到这个远程输入
Android Wear sees this remote input,

38
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,140
不是立即激活这个动作
and instead of firing the action immediately,

39
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,820
而是首先打开一个转录UI收集说出的回复内容
it first launches a transcription UI to collect a spoken response.

40
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,260
在激活手机上的intent之前
Then it puts the transcribed text into the intent,

41
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,480
将转录文本发送到intent
before firing the intent on the phone.

42
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,427
当Gmail启动并发现这个文本
When Gmail starts up and sees this text,

43
00:01:41,427 --> 00:01:43,760
它会知道需要如何完成回复动作
it knows that it has what it needs to complete the reply

44
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,676
然后继续并发送邮件
action, and it can go ahead and send the email

45
00:01:45,676 --> 00:01:48,740
而不用打开手机上的任何UI
without bringing up any UI on the phone.

46
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,180
所以添加语音回复只需要稍微修改两处代码
So adding voice replies just required two small code changes.

47
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,330
首先  改变回复动作以包含一个远程输入
First, changing the reply action to include a remote input.

48
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,290
接着  修改从这个动作
And second, modifying the activity

49
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,140
接收到的intent的activity
that received the intent from this action,

50
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,700
判断intent是否包含一个文本响应
to see if the intent included a text response.

51
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,730
最酷的是通知体验
What's cool is that the notification experience

52
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,964
在手机上并没有改变
on the phone is unchanged.

53
00:02:04,964 --> 00:02:07,380
如果你选择在手机通知栏中回复通知
If you select the reply action on the phone's notification

54
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,830
Gmail会启动同样的activity
shade, Gmail starts the same activity.

55
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,090
但是由于远程输入不密集
But since the remote input isn't populated,

56
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,710
它通常会显示Compose窗口让你输入一个回复
it displays the Compose window as usual to let you type a response.

57
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,050
现在  我们来看看多个消息通知的情况
Now, let's look at the multiple message notification,

58
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,379
它使用多行收件箱样式
which uses the multi-line inbox style.

59
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:23,420
在一个可拓展的设计中
Instead of putting a bunch of short lines of text

60
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,700
我们需要每个邮件单独显示一张卡片
onto a single card, we wanted to have one card for each email,

61
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,970
而不是把一堆短行文本挤在一张卡片上
in an expandable stack.

62
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,760
这些大量的通知卡片
These bundles, or stacks of notification cards,

63
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,080
是通知API的一个新特性
are a new feature in the notification API.

64
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,600
不是将所有的电子邮件线程合并在一起
Instead of posting one notification

65
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,310
发送一个通知
with all of the email threads coalesced,

66
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,060
而是我们发布多个通知  每一封电子邮件一个通知
we post multiple notifications-- one per email.

67
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,610
但是所有这些通知都具有相同的group key
But all of these notifications are marked with the same group

68
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,520
以表明他们是相关的
key, indicating that they're related,

69
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,440
然后它们在可穿戴设备上被组合为一个卡片包
and they should be grouped as a card bundle on the Wearable.

70
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,050
现在我们得到了一个不错的卡片集合
Now we get a nice stack of cards,

71
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,030
你可以通过点击包来展开它们
which you can fan out by tapping the bundle,

72
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,419
然后分别阅读每张卡片
and read the cards individually.

73
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:54,210
注意到在包中的每个卡片
Notice that each of the cards in the bundle

74
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,320
可以有自己的动作
can also have its own actions, so we can now

75
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,390
所以我们可以在这一组中回复或归档单独的邮件
reply to or archive a single email from within the group--

76
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,370
就像我们处理单独的邮件一样
just as we did with a single email.

77
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,487
通知集合还有一个sort key
Notification bundles also have a sort key,

78
00:03:04,487 --> 00:03:07,690
你可以通过设置来控制在包中的卡片的顺序
which you can set to control the ordering of cards within the bundle.

79
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,490
你可以标志包中的一个通知
You can mark one notification in the bundle

80
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,990
作为一个摘要通知
as a summary notification, which is representative

81
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,560
它是整组通知的代表
of the group as a whole.

82
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,340
对于Gmail  我们采用默认的原始收件箱样式通知
For Gmail, we flag the original inbox style notification

83
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,610
作为摘要
as the summary.

84
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,260
摘要通知
The summary notification is displayed

85
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,804
显示在手机通知栏中
on the phone's notification shade.

86
00:03:20,804 --> 00:03:24,570
没有摘要的包是显示在可穿戴设备上的
And the bundle without the summary is displayed on the Wearable.

87
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,250
接下来  让我们看看Hangouts
Next, let's look at Hangouts.

88
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,380
Hangouts消息同样可以自动弥合在可穿戴设备上
Hangouts messages are automatically bridged to the wearable too.

89
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,340
但是我们想要做些细微的改变
But we wanted to make some changes to fine tune

90
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,820
来增强安卓可穿戴设备的体验
the experience for Android Wear devices.

91
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,944
和Gmail一样  我们想要语音回复
As with Gmail, we wanted voice replies.

92
00:03:35,944 --> 00:03:38,360
但是Hangouts的通知是有点不同的
But the Hangouts notifications are a little bit different.

93
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,520
它们没有回复动作
They don't have a reply action, just a content intent that

94
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,880
只有一个content intent打开应用程序  以使你可以输入回复内容
opens up the app, so you can type a response.

95
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,280
这在可穿戴设备上显示为一个手机的Open动作
This shows up as an Open on Phone action on the Wearable.

96
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,840
幸运的是  现在的通知API允许您在手机和可穿戴设备中
Fortunately, the notification API now lets you specify a distinct set

97
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,530
指定不同的动作集合
of actions on phone and Wearable.

98
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,790
手机动作仅仅会显示在手机上
The phone actions will only be displayed on the phone,

99
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,640
同样可穿戴设备的动作只会显示在可穿戴设备上
and the Wearable actions will only be displayed on the Wearable.

100
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,510
这就允许我们添加一个可穿戴设备仅有的回复动作
This allowed us to add a Wearable only reply

101
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,360
包含一个远程输入
action, which includes a remote input without changing

102
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,360
却不改变手机的行为
the phone behavior.

103
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,680
Hangouts 同样使用另一个新的通知功能
Hangouts also uses another new notification feature,

104
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,210
即消息页面
Notification Pages.

105
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,600
我们认为这将很有用  如果在主消息卡片上
We thought it would be useful if you could swipe sideways

106
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,040
滑动侧边栏  你可以在另一个页面
on the main message card to see a second page

107
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,640
看到最近的历史对话记录
with the recent conversation history.

108
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,430
这个不是手机非常必要的
This isn't really necessary on the phone,

109
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,050
因为你可以打开APP去查看历史对话记录
because you can just open the app to see the conversation history.

110
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,900
但是在可穿戴设备上  在回复之前
But on the Wearable, it's nice to get a little extra context

111
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,700
获得额外的上下文是很有必要的
before speaking a response.

112
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,700
为了实现这个功能  我们使用WearableExtentder的AddPage方法
To do this, we use the Add Page method

113
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,940
它允许你在主要的通知上
of Wearable Extender, which allows you to add extra pages of content

114
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,470
添加额外的内容页面
on the primary notification.

115
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,840
我们把chatHistory设置为第二个bigText style的通知
We put the chat history into a second big text style

116
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,020
并将它添加到主通知作为第二页
notification, and add it to the primary notification as a second page.

117
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,270
同样  通知体验在手机上并不会变
Once again, the notification experience on the phone is unchanged.

118
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,740
但是在可穿戴设备上  我们得到了第二页的内容
But on the Wearable, we get the second page of content,

119
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,690
来展示聊天记录
showing the chat history.

120
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,000
这就是Hangouts在可穿戴设备上的一个完整例子
Here's a full example of Hangouts on the wearable.

121
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,240
这是一个图片消息  一页仅仅是一个图片
This is a picture message, with one page for just a photo, one

122
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,790
一页仅仅是聊天历史记录  和一个回复动作
page with the chat history, and a reply action,

123
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,160
来记录一个快速的音频回复
for recording a quick voice reply.

124
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,550
让我们来看Camera
Let's move on to Camera.

125
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,050
我们想为谷歌摄像APP添加一个有趣的功能
We wanted to add a fun little feature to Google's Camera app

126
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,552
这会让你从你的手腕触发快门
that would let you trigger a shutter release from your wrist.

127
00:05:04,552 --> 00:05:07,010
你可能见过具有远程控制功能的高端相机
You've probably seen high end cameras with remote controls,

128
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,297
这里的想法是相同的
and the idea here is the same.

129
00:05:08,297 --> 00:05:10,130
你把你的手机放在三脚架上
You put your phone on a tripod, or maybe you

130
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,546
或是你靠在墙的另一面  或者你让别人帮你拿着相机
lean it against a wall, or you give it to someone to hold.

131
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:16,330
然后你通过按可移动设备上的按钮来触发照相
And then you capture a photo by tapping a button on your watch.

132
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,840
对于Gmail和Hangouts  仅仅通过使用通知API
With Gmail and Hangouts, we did entirely phone-side

133
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,540
我们完全实现了手机端的集成
integrations, using only the notification APIs.

134
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,200
但对于这个例子
But for this use case, it made sense

135
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,201
制作一个可穿戴设备APP是有意义的
to build a Wearable app for a couple of reasons.

136
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:27,491
首先  当全屏运行时  
First, it wouldn't really make sense for the camera app

137
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:29,520
他不会对Camera APP投放消息
to post notifications to the phone shade, when

138
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,080
在手机上产生影响
it was already running full screen,

139
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,496
所以我们知道手机设备上的行为和可穿戴设备上的
so we knew that the behavior on the phone and the wearable

140
00:05:33,496 --> 00:05:34,390
是不对称的
had to be asymmetric.

141
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,180
我们也认为  对于这个例子
Also, we thought that for this use case,

142
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,620
通过可穿戴设备快门按钮接管整个屏幕是合适的
it would be appropriate to take over the entire screen of the Wearable

143
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,530
而不是在屏幕上限制
with the shutter button, instead of confining

144
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:44,220
卡片的按钮功能
the button to a card in the stream.

145
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,557
所以  我们建立了一个简单的应用程序运行在可穿戴设备上
So we built a simple app to run on the Wearable, that

146
00:05:46,557 --> 00:05:49,722
通过谷歌游戏服务来和主要的Camera APP沟通
communicates with the main Camera app, using Google Play services.

147
00:05:49,722 --> 00:05:51,680
当Camera APP准备去拍照的时候
When the Camera app is ready to take a picture,

148
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,780
它将设置一个dataItem
it sets a data item, indicating that it's

149
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,360
表明准备接受远程快门的消息
ready to accept remote shutter messages.

150
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,920
这个数据项是由智能手表上的可穿戴设备APP的一个service来实现读取的
This data item is read by a service within the Wearable app

151
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,320
它上面显示了快门键
on the watch, which displays the shutter button.

152
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,580
按下按钮将发送消息给手机
Tapping the button sends a message back to the phone

153
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,400
来触发快门
to trigger shutter press.

154
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,786
最后  为了预览你刚刚拍摄的照片
Finally, to preview the photo you just took,

155
00:06:07,786 --> 00:06:09,160
手机应用程序创建了一个缩略图
the phone app creates a thumbnail

156
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,860
并将其返回给手表仅作为一个存放数据的物品
and sends it back across to the watch as an asset within a data item.

157
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,500
可穿戴设备读取内容  并全屏预览
The Wearable reads the asset, and displays it full screen for preview.

158
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,100
这就是它最终看起来的效果
Here's what it looks like end to end.

159
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,620
我在手机上打开Camera APP  然后看到一个写有字符串的卡片
I open the Camera app on my phone, and I see a string card.

160
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,260
我可以轻触卡片启动一个
I can tap the card to launch a full screen

161
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,634
具有快门按钮的全屏activity
activity with the shutter button.

162
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:26,010
我轻敲快门按钮  然后经过倒计时后
I tap the shutter button, and after a count down,

163
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,970
我的手机拍下来一张照片  并且可以在可移动设备上预览
my phone takes a photo, and I see a preview on the Wearable.

164
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,350
不错的自拍
Not a bad selfie.

165
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,180
让我们来看谷歌地图
Let's move on to Google Maps.

166
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,890
在语音导航时
During turn by turn navigation, we

167
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,286
我们想在手腕上显示方向
wanted to show direction prompts on your wrist.

168
00:06:37,286 --> 00:06:39,410
这会在你走路时非常管用
These can be especially useful when you're walking,

169
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,970
当你感到拿着你的手机很尴尬时
since it's awkward holding up your phone,

170
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,428
现在你可以更方便的把手机丢在口袋里
and it could be more convenient to leave it in your pocket,

171
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:45,650
然后来靠你的手表来展示方向啦
and refer to turn descriptions on your watch.

172
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,400
因为我们想要在可穿戴设备的
Because we wanted fine grained control

173
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,650
布局和方向的表现上
over the layout and the presentation of the directions

174
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,220
获得更加细粒度的控制
displayed on the wearable, we decided

175
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,100
我们决定制作谷歌地图穿戴APP
to build the Google Maps Wear app, that rendered custom drawn

176
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,930
来呈现自定义信息而不是单纯的消息推送
cards as local only notifications.

177
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,740
我们修改了谷歌地图手机应用程序
We modified the Google Maps phone app

178
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,090
来更新对于数据项的描述信息
to update a data item with the description

179
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,600
下一步机动动作图标
and the icon for the next maneuver,

180
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,980
和导航状态信息
and info about the navigation state.

181
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,140
地图穿戴APP监听数据项的变化
The Maps Wear app listens for changes to this data item.

182
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,260
每次改变  它将重新读取新数据
With each change, it reads the new data,

183
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,780
然后更新卡上的数据到到移动设备上
and updates the card on the Wearable.

184
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,460
为了绘制这张卡片
To draw the card, the Wearable app

185
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,590
可穿戴设备APP使用了WearableExtender的新的displayIntent的功能
uses the new display intent feature of Wearable Extender.

186
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,820
你指定一个activity来绘制
You specify an activity to draw the content

187
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,350
通知卡片上的内容
within a notification card.

188
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,730
这可以使你随心所欲的画上你想显示的内容在卡片上
This lets us just draw whatever we wanted on the card,

189
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:27,250
而不是被标准的通知样式所局限
instead of being constrained to the standard notification styles.

190
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,840
卡片在周围低功率模式下  或是峰值状态下
Cards in ambient low power mode, or in this peaking state,

191
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,150
仍需要使用标准的通知模板
still have to use standard notification templates.

192
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,450
但是当你轻触卡片进入到全屏视图后
But when you swipe the card up into full view,

193
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,980
系统将会改变色调进入自定义视图
the system cross fades the card into a custom view,

194
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,980
由自定义显示activity来绘制
drawn by the custom display activity.

195
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,480
这个有些不爽的是
It's a bit of a bummer that you have

196
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,029
无论是在峰值模式还是环境模式都不得不使用标准样式
to use standard styles in peak mode and in ambient mode,

197
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:46,070
但安卓穿戴设备引用了一些新的
but Android Wear does introduce some new Wearable

198
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,030
可穿戴设备特定的通知模板  就像大的动作样式
specific notification templates, like big action style

199
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,950
和内容图标样式
and content icon style.

200
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,100
最后一个特性
One last feature.

201
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,670
我们同样也想让你开始一个导航会话
We also wanted to let you start a navigation session

202
00:07:54,670 --> 00:08:00,010
通过一个声音命令  比如导航到donuts公司
by speaking a voice command, like navigate to donuts.

203
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,380
为了实现这个  地图穿戴应用有一个activity
To do this, the Maps Wear app has an activity

204
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,410
它具有一个将导航声音动作过滤的intent filter
with an intent filter for the navigate voice action, which

205
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,470
就像这样来创建一个intent
creates an intent like this.

206
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,200
穿戴式应用收到这个intent
The Wear app receives this intent,

207
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,420
并将一条消息发送给手机上的谷歌地图
and sends a message to Google Maps on the phone that

208
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,820
包含一个目的地与到达方式
contains a destination, and a travel mode.

209
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,940
手机地图应用收到这个消息
The Maps phone app receives this message,

210
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,160
并开始一个导航会话到目的地
and starts a navigation session to the destination.

211
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,860
然后你就可以出发了
And off you go.

212
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,490
这就是我们的Gmail Hangoouts Camera 和谷歌地图
That's how we made Gmail, Hangouts, Camera, and Google

213
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,161
都准备好了为安卓穿戴设备而奋斗
Maps, all ready for Android Wear.

214
00:08:24,161 --> 00:08:25,910
我希望它能给你一个很好的介绍关于
I hope it gave you a good overview of what

215
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,690
你可以在安卓穿戴设备平台上做些什么
you can do on the Android Wear platform.

216
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,760
我希望它能激发你定制自己的应用程序
And I hope it inspires you to customize your own application

217
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,599
来更好的支持可穿戴设备的体验
to support a better wearable experience.
