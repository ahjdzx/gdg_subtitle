13
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,120
多年来我们发表的
we published over the years, many of which

14
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,910
其中许多论文直接导致了Google云平台的服务
have led directly to services in the Google Cloud Platform.

15
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,450
你已经知道Google Search  YouTube和Gmail服务 
You already know Google Search and YouTube and Gmail services

16
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,300
他们已经在Google大规模的运行
which run at Google scale.

17
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,550
如果你可以利用这些服务之后的这种规模和创新

and innovation that's behind our services, but for your big idea?

19
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,880
这就是Google云平台的价值所在
This is where the Google Cloud Platform steps in,

20
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,750
让你的应用得到Google的力量

21
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,416
那什么是Google云平台呢
What is the Google Cloud Platform?

22
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:56,790
简单的说  它是一个服务的集合
Well, in brief, it's a collection

23
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,810
这些服务由三个类别组成  计算  存储

24
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,690
和应用程序  以帮助你的应用规模化运行
and application services to help your apps scale.

25
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,710
选择你想要的服务
Pick and choose which services you want,

26
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:09,070
而只需为你使用的资源付款
and only pay for the resources you use.

27
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,950
我们从计算类别开始
We begin with the compute category,

28
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,140
我们已经有了Google App引擎和Google Compute引擎
where we've got Google App Engine and Google Compute Engine.

29
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,930
让我们从Compute引擎开始  我们在基础设施里
Let's start with Compute Engine, our computing solution

30
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,600
的计算方案即服务层

有多大呢
How big?

39
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,895
恩，这里有一个真正的大数据例子

40
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:44,520
比如说你要打算结婚了

48
00:02:03,565 --> 00:02:05,440
为了确认这里面没有任何重复

49
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,160
你需要将所有数据排序
