LEON NICHOLLS: 大家好  我是Leon Nicholls
LEON NICHOLLS: Hi, my name is Leon Nicholls.

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,610
我是Google Cast的一名开发大使
I'm a Developer Advocate for Google Cast.

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,000
在这里我将会告诉你关于Google Cast SDK for Android的一些信息
I'm here to tell you about the Google Cast SDK for Android.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,730
Google Cast SDK支持Android IOS 
The Google Cast SDK supports Android, iOS,

5
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,080
以及桌面版的Chrome平台
and desktop Chrome platforms.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,970
针对这些平台开发的应用程序都能
Apps developed for these platforms can all

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:27,590
与任何Google Cast设备进行交互  如Chromecast
interact with any Google Cast device, such as Chromecast.

8
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,590
The Google Cast sender application

9
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,940
refers to an app running on a mobile device or laptop,

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,500
and the receiver application refers to an HTML application

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,050
running on Chromecast or other Google Cast receiver devices.

12
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,250
The release of the Google Cast SDK

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,180
is the public API for developers of Cast applications.

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,650
From now on, developers are in control

15
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,690
of releasing the Cast apps by using the new Google Cast SDK

16
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,780
developer console.

17
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,250
The Google Cast SDK is now a part of Android's Google Play

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,739
services, and will be shared across all Cast apps.

19
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,730
Let's take a look at the typical life cycle of a Cast sender app.

20
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,340
When the sender app is launched, Cast devices

21
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,530
need to be discovered on the local network.

22
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,520
Once the user selects a device, the sender app

23
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,760
will connect to that device and launch the receiver app.

24
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,070
The sender app then creates a message channel

25
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:29,510
to the receiver app to send and receive messages.

26
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:34,000
The user can also disconnect from that device.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,580
The first step in supporting Cast in an app is to add the Cast button.

28
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,940
There are three choices-- the MediaRouter ActionBar provider,

29
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,310
the MediaRouter button, or a custom button.

30
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:51,400
We recommend the provider since that's the easiest integration.

31
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,290
The Cast button has to be added to the menu for the ActionBar,

32
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,940
or to the activity layout resource file.

33
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,950
The advantage to create a MediaRouter selector, which

34
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,520
will fall to devices to discover only

35
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,710
Cast devices that can run your app.

36
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:11,140
The selector is attached to the Cast button when the activity starts.

37
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,490
Here is an example of how easy it

38
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,810
is to add a Cast button to the ActionBar

39
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,930
[? compat ?] using the MediaRouter ActionBar provider

40
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,340
in your menu XML.

41
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,620
Other ways of integrating the Cast button

42
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:28,350
is documented by the MediaRouter support library.

43
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,060
The sender app also has to tell the MediaRouter to start

44
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,430
discovery of Cast devices by adding

45
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,630
a callback when the activity starts.

46
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,660
The app will be informed by the MediaRouter

47
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,600
when the user has selected a device from the Cast menu.

48
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,580
As a best practice, remove the callback

49
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:51,360
when discovery is no longer needed, to conserve battery usage.

50
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,930
Here's an example of how to add a callback to the MediaRouter

51
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,820
to start device discovery.

52
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:04,230
The device the user has selected is extracted from the callback data.

53
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,630
Now that the sender app knows which Cast device the user has selected,

54
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:12,250
launching the receiver app involves a few steps.

55
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,480
The sender app needs to connect to Google Play Services using

56
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,450
the GoogleAPIClient Cast.

57
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,850
Then the app uses the Cast.CastAPI

58
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,970
Cast to launch the receiver app using the app ID obtained

59
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,560
from the Developer Console.

60
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,930
Once the receiver app has launched,

61
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,760
the sender can create a media message channel or a custom

62
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,530
message channel to the receiver.

63
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,910
The app has to handle various callbacks

64
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:43,140
about the application and the channel status.

65
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,390
Here's an example of how to launch the receiver

66
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:50,230
app once the sender app has connected to Google Play services.

67
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,930
The result callback is invoked with the launch status

68
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,650
and the application metadata.

69
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,920
Note the same asynchronous callback model

70
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,240
is used throughout the life cycle of a Cast app.

71
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,580
To play media on the receiver, the sender app

72
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:11,210
has to create a MediaInfo instance with the URL of the media stream.

73
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,880
The RemoteMediaPlayer Cast is then

74
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,880
used to load that media stream on the receiver.

75
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,360
The sender app then accepts commands such as play and pause

76
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,140
using the RemoteMediaPlayer.

77
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,000
The sender app has to handle callbacks about the media

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,730
status during playback.

79
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,090
Finally, let's take a look at an example

80
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,510
of how to create a MediaInfo instance for a video stream.

81
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,390
The video stream is loaded on the receiver using

82
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,180
the RemoteMediaPlayer instance.

83
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,700
The ResultCallback is invoked with the load command status.

84
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,490
You can get more details about the Google Cast SDK

85
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,530
at developers.google.com/cast.

86
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,440
It's also important to take a look at the Cast Design

87
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,750
Checklist, which has design implications for your app.

88
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,640
We've also opened source sample Cast apps

89
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,160
that you can use as a reference.

90
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,740
